# About me? 
I'm always working on new stuff or learning about technology and code, so, I wanted to share my projects with all of you. This way, you can see my code, learn from me or giving some advice about how to improve my coding (**please, do it!**).

By now, I'm learning about web developing. That's cool because GitHub let's you deploy your own web projects and share them, so I think this is a perfect reason to update my acount once for all.

# See my progress with the web!
## My Personal Projects
### Fatum
This was my very first real project. I made it for a friend of mine, who needed a place to show her art, as a end-of-course project. I'm very proud of it.

If you want to take a look, here you have the [web](https://jesusalgon.github.io/fatum) and the [code](https://github.com/jesusalgon/fatum).

## Course: CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
This is my actual course. It is about a bit of all, but focused mostly on front-end. These guys are great, I truly recommend any of their courses.
### Project 0: Search
That was so funny. With just **HTML** and **CSS** I had to replicate the Google Search front-end. It even works as the original! </br>
To make it a little more interesting, I decided to use **SASS** and **Bootstrap** for first time. They are awesome! I even made the web responsive in just a few minutes.

To see the result, here you have the [web](https://jesusalgon.github.io/CS50-Search) and the code [code](https://github.com/jesusalgon/CS50-Search).
